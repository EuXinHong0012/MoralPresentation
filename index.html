						<aside class="notes">
						Video Games are electronic games or a form of digital entertainment where we humans as users or players can interact with the game through interfaces emitted from computer or television monitor by controlling the options or making decisions by input through physical device like mouse, keyboard or console controllers. There are currently multiple platform that runs video games, such as PC’s and consoles. There are also myriad of genre that can be classified as video games such as (First Person Shooter) FPS, (Real Time Strategy) RTS, and so on. While some games can be played in single player mode without the usage of internet, those are video games through storytelling such as “Half-Life”. While some games requires the internet because it involves online social interactions that let the players to cooperate together in order to achieve a common goal such as “Counter Strike: Global Offensive” are classified as “Online games”. Whatever type of video games there are, as long as it is a form of digital entertainment that involves a user/player able to control and interact with it like making decisions in a virtual world, it can be classified as a video game.

						<h2>Moral Question</h2>
						<p class="fragment" style="color: #FF0000; text-shadow: 1px 1px #ff0000;"><b>Should the government regulate online games?</b></p>

						<h2>Disputed</h2>
						<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">People harmed because of abusieve gaming</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">The context of games matters</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Young players are not matured enough</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
						Most of the cause that motivates the government to regulate in online games in the first place are because of incidents of addicted players causing trouble and chaos to society through playing online games. For instance, when some players got addicted and “brainwashed” by violence online games they might go full rage quit mode and destroying private property and so on or even harming the public such as many school shooting incident in the United States. It became a serious issue when players addicted to online gaming shows sign of psychopathy. 
						The context of an online game will be a factor towards the government decisions of banning or restrict the game distributed to the public. Depending on the objective of the game and the theme surrounding it, if the game promotes sexual nudity, violence, or even terrorism or usage of drugs to the players. This may influence the players to conduct barbaric actions if they are emotionally unstable plus addicted to playing it. Boosting the crime rate including robbery, stealing, serial murder, or even massacres such as many school shootings incidents has been happening in the United States. Thus the government will see that if the context of the particular game has offered no benefit but risk to the safety of the public so they will likely to consider restrict or ban it.
						Since there’s been addiction of playing online games among players especially youths that are not matured enough to make proper decisions and control themselves. Therefore there must be an organization/body (government) to help them to control the time spend on playing online games if the parents cannot control and educate the youths properly.

						<h2>What matters morally?</h2>
						<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Decision making based on player (good and bad)</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">No living biengs harmed</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
						Many games feature some form of decision-making process that can paint the player, and their character, as a good or bad guy. Some games deal with the most basic of moralities, such as “Postal 2” approach of being an ordinary civilian or a super psychopathic badass, achieved by either finishing simple task such as going to buy a milk from a grocery store, or doing the same task with an evil, going to the grocery store with an automated assault rifle with a cat stuffed in the barrel of the rifle as a silencer massacring everyone in the process and does not pay for the milk. 
						Therefore, it is the gamers that decided the outcome of a scene in any video game. The player decide whether they should act morally or immorally when playing video games.

						If the government had regulated online games, there will be two sides that will support and against the government respectively. 
						It is estimated that with the government’s action to regulate online games will help lower the parent’s burden in controlling their children in playing online games, while also help lowering the chances of violence outbreak in public because of psychopathy players. Besides that, in the case that the parents could not help control their children from playing online game 24 hours, for example the children may skip school and go to the nearest cyber café to play games without the consent of the parents. The government may step in to help monitor and restrict their playtime through the power of technology. 

						But this could also led the video game companies go against this action, as this action may pose a threat to their business that is to distribute games to their clients. With this regulation, it will lower the profits of the game companies.

						<li class="fragment fade-up">Some players are not matured enough.</li>

						<li class="fragment fade-up">World Health Organization had classified gaming as a disorder.</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
						Some gamers are underage and not matured enough to make proper decisions.

						They cannot control the time spent on playing video games themselves and this will furthermore increase their addiction. 

						They also cannot act rationally such as imitate the actions in video game in real life and this will led them to become more violent and eventually became psychopathic. 

						While some parents cannot fully control their children from playing online games 24 hours a day. As some children can secretly play game outside of their homes or when the parents are outside working, or even outsmart the parent’s methods efforts in locking their Computers and Game Consoles. The government have the technological capabilities of controlling and monitoring. For example, instead of locking only one computer, the parents can enable a locking system provided by the government to lock their children’s online game account (i.e. Steam) so the children cannot play their games even they are outside of their house. 


						Some video games conflicts with the nation’s interest. 

						Games that contain contexts that may threaten the national security. Such as games that influence and promote violence and terrorism.

						While some video game companies that tried to rule over the nation’s media policy and challenge the government resulting in a threat to the nation’s sovereignty.


						The World Health Organization (WHO) had classified gaming as a disorder 
						(ICD-11) 

						Characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.

						Even if the WHO had nothing to do with or forced the government, since WHO had classified gaming as a disorder with legit reasons. The government should further analysis this statement and as a result it turned out that there are supporting reasons for government to regulate playing online games better that did not regulate.  For the better of the public health, and to avoid more civilians for having this disorder. Just like the concept of medicinal drugs, as gaming can be a good activity with the right amount of dosage, but it can be deadly and harmful if there’s too much.

						<h2>Objecting</h2>
						<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">The freedom of gaming.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Skills earned from gaming.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">A Way to reduce stress.</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
						The freedom of gaming.

						Online gaming should be not controlled in any way because the citizens have the rights to enjoy all the contents in a video game without any censorship as well as to express themselves through playing video games. 

						If the government regulates gaming, this may give the citizen a feel of suppression and uncomfortable. It is also not necessary and not a priority for the government to do so as the government should focus on regulate other things because gaming isn’t the major factor towards the threat of national security. 


						Skills earned from gaming.

						Online games may encourage gamers to improve their social and communication among other gamers. Through playing online games, they will learn to cooperate well from one to other, forming a good teamwork. As well as having good problem-solving skills. 

						Some games may also help the gamers with valuable skills that may help them get a job and earn profit and nurture their talents. Such as trading and art skills. In example, by trading virtual items in-game with real world money, gamers can experience similar to physical goods trading. There are also risks but this could be a stepping stone for them to acquiring this set of skills along with earning some extra income. Besides that, some games let the creativity of gamers become a reality such as “Roblox” that’s a game creation platform that allows users to design their own games and play. The gamers will learn how to do 3D modeling, scripting game mechanics with “Lua 5.1” programming language and so on.  


						A way to reduce stress

						Stress has always existed, everyone has stress weather it’s from work or school or in life. Some stress are big while some are small, but in the end we all have to find a way to cope with it. While some people might find some recreational activities such as sports to reduce stress from work or school. This may not be an effective way for everyone especially those with weak physical bodies. With gaming, it is another way to reduce stress. Gaming can be a way for us to vent our rage when we have a bad day and does not require vast amount of physical energy. 

						With gaming, in some games players can play casually and simply do whatever they desire in a virtual world where there are no restrictions. An example such as “Minecraft” where players can built what they want in game. This lets the players a sense of freedom and they can do whatever they want. While in some other games players can relief stress by destroy things in game without actually harming real people or real physical things. With virtual technology it almost feels like in real life.

					<h2>Our Position</h2>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
Our Thoughts

- Government should regulate online games 
  with right amount of moderation.

- Gaming may cause addiction and promotes 
  violence but not all games are like that.
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
					The government should regulate online games but with the right amount of control and freedom. The government may enforce different set of rules and restrictions to different category of citizens in order to assist them in controlling their time and money spent in online games but at the same time preserving the liberty of gaming. Voluntary regulation and rating systems of video games such as ERSB ratings can be a perfect example for the government to refer to.
					According to WHO, gaming is a type of disorder .We disagree that as it as if doing so may cause a misunderstanding of discrimination to the gamers, but we do agree that online games can be a catalyst towards increasing addiction and promotes violence if abused. That is why the government should regulate online games. 
					</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>Justifications</h2>
						<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
						<li class="fragment highlight-blue">☑ Role of government is to promote general welfare.</li>
						<li class="fragment highlight-green">☑ Utilitarianism</li>
						<li class="fragment highlight-green">☑ It is morally acceptable</li>
						</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
					The role of the government is promote the good Welfare. Thus, if the government regulate online games, it will benefit all of us, helping the youth to control their addiction towards gaming and reducing the rage and chaos cause by gamers that are mentally unstable by censoring certain content in games. As stated in social contract theory, everyone will have to sacrifice certain interests to have a common interest that is for the better of the youths or our next generation. 
					This action also followed the Utilitarianism theory, as morality is about making the world happy and equal. So does the government needed to control online games, to balance the happiness and peace of gamers and non-gamers. By reducing the addiction and violence of gamers because of influence of online games through restricting the time for underage gamers to play online and censor certain things in games to reduce the negative influence of games. 
					Therefore, it is morally acceptable for the government to regulate online games.

					<section>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
					Playing video games is not illegal, but by playing too much may cause addiction and change our behavior and it may makes us do psychopathic things. So we must know when to play and when to stop. But some of us cannot control it, therefore, the government have to regulate online games because of current situations where too many cases of gamers become addicted and abusive. It is the government role to regulate online gaming for the better cause of everyone. And it is our moral duty to enforce the regulations as long as it is fair and morally right.
